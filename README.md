This course is about manipulating data accessed through databases to prepare it for analysis using Python tools. SQL and NoSQL
technologies are the core database technologies used. ElasticSearch will be the NoSQL store that weâ€™ll be using to provide access 
to some assignment data for this course. The data used for assignments varies in structure and volume. It includes poorly structured 
and usergenerated content data. The data are stored in various formats, and come from a variety of locatons including customer
transactions, air transportation, corporate email, and customer evaluations of hospitality experiences.
